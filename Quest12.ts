//QUESTION: 12
//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just
 //printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same,
 // but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

 let Names:string[]=["MAHPARA","YASMEEN","AMMARAH","SITARA"];
for(let i=0;i<Names.length;i++)
{
    console.log("HI "+Names[i]+"! you are the star of future in shaa Allah");
